This case experience program was composed of three dashboard projects using Power BI. It was an online internship with three main tasks to complete. which are:

- **Call Centre Trends Report**: Analysed customer satisfaction, call abandonment, handling, and agent performance to identify areas for improvement.
- **Telecom Customer Retention Report**: Conducted an EDA on key factors affecting customer churn.
- **HR Diversity & Inclusion Report**: Visualised relevant KPIs in hiring, promotion, performance, and employee turnover to promote diversity and inclusion in the workplace.

The stakeholders' specifications were precisely followed in the development of all three of the above dashboards. The final dashboard was then submitted along with its key insights.
